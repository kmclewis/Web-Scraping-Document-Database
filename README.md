# Web-Scraping-Document-Database
This project incorporated web scraping in order to populate a flask app.  Using Jupyter Notebook, several sites devoted to Mars were scraped either for daily headlines or panetary facts.  The Jupyter Notebook code was converted to python and the data was stored in a MongoDB.  Using a html template, the flask app was served and could be updated with a button that would call the web scraping function.
